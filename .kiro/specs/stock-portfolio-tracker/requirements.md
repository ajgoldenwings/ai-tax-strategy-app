# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a .NET application that manages personal stock portfolios by tracking daily stock holdings and trade transactions. The system will maintain a historical record of stock positions over time, allowing users to see their portfolio composition on any given day and track how their holdings have changed through various trades. The application will use Bootstrap for the frontend styling, utilizing only Bootstrap CSS classes without inline CSS.
